       given an array[] of n positive integers and m queries. each query consists of two integers l and r represented by a range. for each query, find the count of numbers that lie in the given range which can be expressed as the sum of any subset of given array.

        prerequisite : subset sum queries using bitset â‰¤

        examples:


    input : arr[] = { 1, 2, 2, 3, 5 }, m = 4 l = 1, r = 2 l = 1, r = 5 l = 3, r = 6 l = 9, r = 30
    output : 2 5 4 5
    explanation : for the first query, in range [1, 2] all numbers i.e. 1 and 2 can be expressed as a subset sum, 1 as 1, 2 as 2. for the second query, in range [1, 5] all numbers i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 can be expressed as subset sum, 1 as 1, 2 as 2, 3 as 3, 4 as 2 + 2 or 1 + 3, 5 as 5. for the third query, in range [3, 6], all numbers i.e. 3, 4, 5 and 6 can be expressed as subset sum. for the last query, only numbers 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 can be expressed as subset sum, 9 as 5 + 2 + 2, 10 as 5 + 2 + 2 + 1, 11 as 5 + 3 + 2 + 1, 12 as 5 + 3 + 2 + 2 and 13 as 5 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1.

       So the learning here is we can use BitMask to find all the subset sum
       O(N*MaxSum) time

       For e.g.
        [1, 2, 4] => Array
        Now we have initial sum as {0} => Mean mask = 0000001
        Now comes, 1. So 1 can be part of it or not, if not, then sum is {0} => 0000001
                         if yes then it would be added with all {0} -> {0+1, 1} And 1 itself, so {1} => 0000010
        Now we need to union of these two sets, {0,1} => or in bit mask we have to do the | of it. 0000011

        Now, let's talk about 2.
          case 1: Don't include {0,1} =>     0000011
          case 2: Include => {0,1}-> {2, 3} => So what is happening, the existing bit mask is left shifted by 2 (adding 1) => 0001100 (previous one
           left shifted)
            And then do the or (Union) => 0001111 saying {0,1,2,3} => All this can be formed

        Superb !!
