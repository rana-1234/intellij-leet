******************** Fail State ***************

A Fail state ("Type": "Fail") stops the execution of the state machine and marks it as a failure, unless it is caught by a Catch block.

Additional Fields

    Cause (Optional)
        A custom failure string that you can specify for operational or diagnostic purposes.

    Error (Optional)
         An error name that you can provide for operational or diagnostic purposes.

Because Fail states always exit the state machine, they have no Next field and don't require an End field.
    "FailState": {
      "Type": "Fail",
      "Cause": "Invalid response.",
      "Error": "ErrorA"
