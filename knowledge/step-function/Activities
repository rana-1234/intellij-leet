*************** Activities *****************
Activities are an AWS Step Functions feature that enables you to have a task in your state machine where the work is performed by a worker that can be hosted on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), mobile devicesâ€”basically anywhere.

In AWS Step Functions, activities are a way to associate code running somewhere (known as an activity worker) with a specific task in a state machine
You can create an activity using the Step Functions console, or by calling CreateActivity

An activity worker can be an application running on an Amazon EC2 instance, an AWS Lambda function, a mobile device:
any application that can make an HTTP connection, hosted anywhere

When Step Functions reaches an activity task state, the workflow waits for an activity worker to poll for a task

GetActivityTask returns a response including input (a string of JSON input for the task) and a taskToken (a unique identifier for the task).
After the activity worker completes its work, it can provide a report of its success or failure by using SendTaskSuccess or SendTaskFailure.

********************* Waiting for an Activity Task to Complete *************************
Configure how long a state waits by setting TimeoutSeconds in the task definition.
To keep the task active and waiting, periodically send a heartbeat from your activity worker using SendTaskHeartbeat within the time configured in TimeoutSeconds
By configuring a long timeout duration and actively sending a heartbeat, an activity in Step Functions can wait up to a year for an execution to complete.
