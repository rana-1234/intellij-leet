****************** Wait ******************
A Wait state ("Type": "Wait") delays the state machine from continuing for a specified time. You can choose either a relative time, specified in seconds from when the state begins, or an absolute end time, specified as a timestamp.

One of the following field is required in Wait state

Seconds
A time, in seconds, to wait before beginning the state specified in the Next field. You must specify time as a positive, integer value.

Timestamp
    An absolute time to wait until beginning the state specified in the Next field.

    Timestamps must conform to the RFC3339 profile of ISO 8601, with the further restrictions that an uppercase T must separate the date and time portions, and an uppercase Z must denote that a numeric time zone offset is not present, for example, 2016-08-18T17:33:00Z.

SecondsPath
    A time, in seconds, to wait before beginning the state specified in the Next field, specified using a path from the state's input data.

TimestampPath
    An absolute time to wait until beginning the state specified in the Next field, specified using a path from the state's input data.

E.g.

    "wait_ten_seconds": {
      "Type": "Wait",
      "Seconds": 10,
      "Next": "NextState"
    }

    "wait_until" : {
      "Type": "Wait",
      "Timestamp": "2016-03-14T01:59:00Z",
      "Next": "NextState"
    }

    ===================
    {
      "expirydate": "2016-03-14T01:59:00Z"
    }

    "wait_until" : {
        "Type": "Wait",
        "TimestampPath": "$.expirydate",
        "Next": "NextState"
    }
